# Physiology

A mod that introduces a robust health system to minecraft.

## Kinesis

A system composed of 2 sub-systems stamina and endurance.
*modifiers* -> player musculature and metabolism influences Kinesis

### stamina

Stamina is used as a short-term energy supply system, depletes quickly and
replenishes slowly overtime, once the stamina system depletes it gives way to
the endurance system

### endurance

This is a more long-term energy system, depletes slowly over time and replenishes
only when the individual rests(sleep, sitting) and when they eat.
