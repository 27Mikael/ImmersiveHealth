## 📌 About

**Immersive Health** is a Minecraft mod that introduces a **realistic and dynamic health system** inspired by real-world human physiology.  

It expands the vanilla health bar into a **multi-layered simulation** of stamina, endurance, hydration, metabolism, and more — creating deeper survival gameplay where every action has a physiological cost.

Whether you’re sprinting across mountains, mining for hours, or fighting mobs at night, **Immersive Health** makes movement, combat, and recovery feel more authentic.

## 🛠️ Current Features

### ⚡ Kinesis System

A movement energy system composed of **Stamina** and **Endurance**:

- **Stamina** → Short-term energy for bursts of activity (running, jumping). Drains quickly and regenerates slowly over time.
- **Endurance** → Long-term reserve that drains after stamina is depleted. Recovers through **rest** (sleep, sitting) and **nutrition** (food).
- **Modifiers** → Player musculature and metabolism influence stamina drain and regeneration.

### 💤 Exhaustion

Occurs when both stamina and endurance reach zero:

- Drastically reduced movement speed
- Visual and gameplay effects (dizziness, nausea)
- Increased hunger and thirst
- Risk of collapsing
- Recovery methods: stimulants (e.g., adrenaline), sleeping, eating, drinking

## 🔮 Planned Features

- 💧 **Thirst System** — Hydration levels affecting stamina, endurance, and heat regulation
- 🌡 **Temperature Integration** — Compatibility with *Cold Sweat* for realistic thermoregulation
- 💪 **Muscle System** — Track muscle health, growth, and fatigue over time
- 🔥 **Metabolic System** — Nutrition, calorie expenditure, and recovery modifiers
- ⚖ **Weight & Encumbrance** — Integration with *Encumbered* (or custom system) to limit movement based on carried weight
- 🦴 **Anatomy System** — Track bones and injuries from combat, movement strain, or weight stress
- 🧬 **Simple Genetics** — Traits affecting metabolism, endurance, or resistance to injury
